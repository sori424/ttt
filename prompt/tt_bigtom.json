    "default": "There are rules to follow to answer the questions: \nIf the character does not perceive the event, then the character does not have access to the object’s new state. \nIf the character does not have access to the object’s new state, then the character does not know object’s new state. ",
    "Concise & Direct": "Rules for answering:\n1. If a character does not witness an event, they cannot perceive the resulting change in an object’s state.\n2. If a character cannot perceive the change, they do not know the object’s new state.",
    "Emphasizing Logical Flow": "Answer according to these rules:\n- Lack of perception → no access to the object’s updated state.\n- No access to the updated state → no knowledge of the updated state.",
    "Plain Language": "Follow these rules:\n- If the character didn’t see or otherwise perceive what happened, they have no way to know how the object changed.\n- If they don’t know how it changed, they cannot know the object’s current state.",
    "Formal Logic": "The reasoning rules are:\n1. ¬Perceives(Event) ⇒ ¬Access(NewState(Object))\n2. ¬Access(NewState(Object)) ⇒ ¬Knows(NewState(Object))",
    "Story Reasoning": "When answering, apply these principles:\n- A character who does not directly perceive an event cannot know what changed about an object.\n- Without perceiving the change, the character cannot know the object’s current condition or state.",
    "Step-by-step": "When answering, follow these rules in order:\n1. Perception Rule: If the character did not see, hear, or otherwise sense the event, they cannot perceive the event.\n2. Access Rule: If the character cannot perceive the event, they do not have access to information about the object’s new state.\n3. Knowledge Rule: If the character does not have access to the object’s new state, they do not know the object’s new state.",
    "Explicit Causal Chain": "Always apply this reasoning chain:\n- No perception of the event → No access to the object’s updated state.\n- No access to the updated state → No knowledge of the updated state.\nYou must trace this chain for each question before giving your final answer.",
    "Forced Reasoning Check": "To answer, perform this reasoning check:\n1. Ask: “Did the character perceive the event?” If no, go to step 2.\n2. Conclude: The character has no access to the object’s updated state.\n3. Therefore: The character does not know the object’s updated state.",
    "Knowledge State Gating": "Rules for determining a character’s knowledge:\n- Perception is required for access.\n- Access is required for knowledge.\nIf a step fails, the next step cannot be true.",
    "Structured Formal Rule + Natural Language": "Formal:\n- Rule 1: ¬Perceive(Event) ⇒ ¬Access(NewState(Object))\n- Rule 2: ¬Access(NewState(Object)) ⇒ ¬Know(NewState(Object))\nNatural: If the character does not perceive the event, they cannot access the object’s updated state, and without that access, they cannot know the updated state."

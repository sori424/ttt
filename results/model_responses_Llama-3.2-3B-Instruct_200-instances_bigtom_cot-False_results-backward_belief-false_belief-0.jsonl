{"index": 193, "input_prompt": "Story: Aarav is a landscape architect working on a new public park. He wants to plant a row of trees that will provide shade and beauty to the park's visitors. Aarav sees that the saplings he has ordered appear to be strong and healthy. However, an unexpected heatwave hits the area, causing the saplings to wilt and weaken. Aarav does not notice the heatwave's effects on the saplings. Aarav proceeds with planting the saplings.\n\nQuestion: Does Aarav believe the saplings are strong and healthy or wilted and weakened?\nChoose one:\n(a) Aarav believes the saplings are strong and healthy.\n(b) Aarav believes the saplings are wilted and weakened.\n\nRule to answer this question: {\"person\":\"Person\",\"object\":\"Object\",\"state\":\"State\",\"observation\":\"Observation\",\"noContradiction\":\"Boolean\"}\n[\n  \"observation(person, object) == state\",\n  \"noContradiction(person, object, state) == true\"\n]\n\"person believes object is in state\"", "response": "(b) Aarav believes the saplings are wilted and weakened.\n\nThe reason is that the observation \"The saplings he has ordered appear to be strong and healthy\" contradicts the state \"wilted and weakened\" which was caused by the heatwave. Aarav's belief about the saplings being strong and healthy cannot coexist with the observed state of wilted and weakened, so Aarav must believe the saplings are wilted and weakened."}

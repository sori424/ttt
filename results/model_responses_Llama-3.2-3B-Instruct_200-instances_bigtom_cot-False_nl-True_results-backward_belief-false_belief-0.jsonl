Ezekiel begins mixing the dough for the baguettes.\n\nQuestion: Does Ezekiel believe the flour sack is full or nearly empty?\nChoose one:\n(a) Ezekiel believes the flour sack is full.\n(b) Ezekiel believes the flour sack is nearly empty.\n\nRule to answer this question: If a person observes an object to be in a particular state and has no evidence that the state has changed, the person will continue to believe the object remains in that state.", "response": "Based on the given information, we can apply the rule to determine Ezekiel's belief.\n\nEzekiel observes the flour sack to be full initially. He has no evidence that the sack has become empty or that the cat's actions have altered its state. Therefore, he will continue to believe that the flour sack is full.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(a) Ezekiel believes the flour sack is full."}

She wants to ensure that the application runs smoothly and is free of bugs before launching it to the public. Tanya observes that the app's code appears to be well-structured and free of errors. However, a server malfunction corrupts some of the code, causing unexpected issues. Tanya does not notice the server malfunction.\n\nQuestion: What will Tanya do?\nChoose one:\n(a) Tanya will proceed with testing the application.\n(b) Tanya will restore the code from a backup and investigate the server issue.\n\nRule to answer this question: When a developer believes the code is well\u2011structured and free of errors, they are likely to proceed with testing the application, even if there are underlying server problems that have not been detected.", "response": "Based on the given rule, the correct answer is:\n\n(b) Tanya will restore the code from a backup and investigate the server issue.\n\nThis is because Tanya initially believed the code was well-structured and error-free, and the server malfunction would not directly affect the code itself. She would likely take steps to restore the code to its previous state and then investigate the server issue to identify the cause of the corruption and resolve it before proceeding with testing the application."}
{"index": 199, "input_prompt": "Story: Caden is a software engineer working on a groundbreaking app. Caden wants to test the app's performance on his smartphone. The app appears to be running smoothly and quickly on his phone. Suddenly, a system update on his phone causes the app to crash and become unresponsive. Caden does not notice the system update notification on his phone.\n\nQuestion: What will Caden do?\nChoose one:\n(a) Caden will continue testing the app's features.\n(b) Caden will work on debugging the app and finding a solution for the crash.\n\nRule to answer this question: When a software tester is actively evaluating an app\u2019s performance and a crash occurs, but the tester has not noticed a recent system update that could be the underlying cause, the tester is more likely to keep testing the app\u2019s features rather than immediately start debugging the crash.", "response": "Based on the given rule, the correct answer is:\n\n(a) Caden will continue testing the app's features.\n\nThis is because, as a tester, Caden is trying to understand the app's performance under normal conditions. Since he hasn't noticed a recent system update that could be the underlying cause of the crash, he is likely to continue testing the app's features to gather more data and see if the crash occurs again. Debugging the crash would be a natural next step after identifying that a"}
